**A) About Hackathon:-**

Customer behavior and booking possibilities have been radically changed by online hotel reservation channels. Cancellations or no-shows cause a significant number of hotel reservations to be canceled. Cancellations can be caused by a variety of factors, such as scheduling conflicts, changes in plans, etc. In many cases, this is made easier by the possibility of doing so free or at a low cost, which is beneficial for hotel guests but less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing for hotels.

As a Data Scientist, your job is to build a Machine Learning model to help the Hotel Owners better understand if the customer is going to honor the reservation or cancel it ?

**B) About the Dataset:-** Dataset contains following files,

**b1) Train:-** 18137 rows x 18 columns   

**b2) Test:-** 18138 rows x 17 columns

d1) This hackathon supports private and public leaderboards

d2) The public leaderboard is evaluated on 50% of Test data

d3) The private leaderboard will be made available at the end of the hackathon which will be evaluated on 100% of Test data

# Summary
